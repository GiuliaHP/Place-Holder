The project currently uses the compatibility mode where the Render Graph API is disabled. Support for this mode will be removed in future Unity versions. Migrate existing ScriptableRenderPasses to the new RenderGraph API. After the migration, disable the compatibility mode in Edit > Projects Settings > Graphics > Render Graph.
